**MyShop** is a modern, responsive e-commerce website built with **Next.js (v15+)** and **Tailwind CSS**. It integrates with the DummyJSON API to fetch product data dynamically. The frontend leverages multiple rendering techniques—**Static Site Generation (SSG)**, **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**, and **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**—to optimize performance and user experience.

State management is handled through custom React contexts: **AuthContext** manages user authentication, and **CartContext** manages the shopping cart functionality. Navigation and routing are implemented using Next.js’s app router. The entire frontend is designed with mobile-first responsiveness to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

The project is deployed on **Vercel** for fast and scalable hosting.
